## 💡 Pro Tips

### Adding More Media

   - Add new items to `items` array

# After changes in content folder

```

### Cache Management

- Version change triggers instant cache refresh
- Users get updates on next app launch

### Performance Tips
- Compress large videos before adding
- Keep individual files under 100 MB (GitHub limit)
- Use JPG/WebP for photos (smaller than PNG)
- Use MP4/WebM for videos (smaller than MOV)
