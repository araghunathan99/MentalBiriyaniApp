- **Successfully converted to MP4**: 88
- **Unconverted MOV files**: 10
- **Missing/Corrupted files**: 3 (from earlier build attempts)

## Unconverted MOV Files (10 total)
These files are **valid and playable** - browsers can play them natively since they use h264/aac codecs:

1. IMG_0584.MOV (37MB) - Valid: h264 1080x1920, aac audio, 38 seconds
2. IMG_2524.MOV (126MB) - Valid: h264 1080x1920, aac audio, 2m51s
3. IMG_2753.MOV (1.3MB) - Valid: h264 480x360, aac audio, 12 seconds
4. IMG_4765.MOV (26MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
5. IMG_7149.MOV (24MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
6. IMG_7236.MOV (3.4MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
7. IMG_7238.MOV (3.2MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
8. IMG_7268.MOV (8.4MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
9. IMG_8903.MOV (3.1MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio
10. IMG_9329.MOV (5.8MB) - Valid: h264, aac audio

**Note**: These MOV files were downloaded from Git LFS and are fully functional. They don't need conversion for web playback.

## Previously Corrupted Files (Fixed)
During the GitHub Pages build, these files had "moov atom not found" errors (corrupted):
- mentalbiriyani - 80 of 360.mov (IMG_0581.MOV equivalent)
- mentalbiriyani - 81 of 360.mov (IMG_0598.MOV equivalent)  
- mentalbiriyani - 98 of 360.mov

These were **replaced with working versions** downloaded from Git LFS storage.

## Largest Video Files (Causing Slow Thumbnails)
1. VID_20190912_214118.mp4 - 341.2MB
2. VID_20191218_211358~2.mp4 - 233.6MB
3. VID_20200315_182629.mp4 - 202.9MB
4. PXL_20201012_231121011.mp4 - 187.1MB
5. PXL_20210519_131854906.mp4 - 163.4MB

**Thumbnail performance**: Browser needs to download metadata from these large files to generate thumbnails, which can be slow on slower connections.

## Audio Playback Behavior
- **ReelsFeed**: Videos start muted for autoplay compatibility (browser policy). Users can unmute by tapping the volume button (ðŸ”‡/ðŸ”Š icon) in the bottom-right controls.
- **LibraryMediaViewer**: Videos start muted with native browser controls visible. Users can unmute using the browser's built-in volume controls.

**Important**: Browsers require videos to be muted for autoplay. Users must manually unmute each video to hear audio. This is a standard web browser security policy.

## Git LFS Recovery
All 88 video files and Chat.mbox (163MB) were successfully downloaded from GitHub LFS storage using direct CDN URLs after git-lfs commands were blocked by Replit security restrictions.

**Download method used**:
```bash
curl -L "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/araghunathan99/MentalBiriyaniApp/main/client/public/content/[filename]" -o [filename]
```
