# MentalBiriyani - A Curated Nostalgia Ride

## Overview
MentalBiriyani is an Instagram Reels-inspired mobile web application designed to display photos and videos from a local content folder in an immersive, swipeable feed. Its primary purpose is to provide a curated nostalgia experience with a dark-first UI, gesture-driven interactions, full-screen Reels view, grid library view, media liking with local preference storage, and unique URL sharing for individual items. The project aims to deliver a PWA-enabled, static frontend application suitable for various static hosting environments, offering a rich media consumption experience without a backend. It includes a business vision to offer a personal, curated media experience, recognizing market potential in digital scrapbooking and personal archives, with an ambition to evolve into a customizable digital memory capsule.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a dark-first UI, optimized for media consumption, with a mobile-first approach and gesture-based interactions. Key UI patterns include a dynamic loading screen, full-screen Reels feed with randomized media using **CSS Scroll Snap** for native, smooth scrolling transitions, a grid view with filtering and liked media bubbling, a library viewer with gesture/keyboard controls, bottom navigation, and toast notifications. Controls are tap-to-toggle for a clean interface. The grid view displays 4 columns for a more compact media display. **Reels Navigation:** The Reels view uses CSS scroll snap (`scroll-snap-type: y mandatory`, `scroll-snap-align: center`, `overscroll-behavior-y: contain`) for paginated vertical scrolling, where each media item occupies full viewport height (100dvh) with 56px bottom padding to center content between the viewport top and bottom menu bar. Media elements use `max-w-full max-h-full object-contain` for proper aspect ratio without clipping. Horizontal scrolling is prevented with `overflow-x: hidden` and `touch-action: pan-y`. A subtle fade effect transitions items between 40% and 100% opacity (0.4s duration) during scroll, with the active centered item at full opacity and the first item loading at full opacity. Pagination dots have been removed for a cleaner interface. All media items are rendered in the DOM with scroll-based navigation, providing native browser scroll behavior with automatic snap points. JavaScript-based navigation (keyboard arrows, mouse wheel) uses instant snapping (`behavior: 'auto'`) for fast transitions. This approach provides Instagram-like swipe experience with better performance and native feel across all devices.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state management. Shadcn UI components (New York style) built on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management:** Local state with React hooks, TanStack Query for caching server state, and LocalStorage for persisting user preferences (liked media).
- **Local Media System:** Media files are stored in `public/content/` and configured via `public/content/media-list.json`. The system supports common image and video formats, relying on static asset serving with no external API dependencies or authentication. Dynamic content loading automatically generates content lists (`media-list.json`, `audio-list.json`, `chat-list.json`) at build time from content folders. Automated thumbnail generation using FFmpeg (videos) and Sharp (images) occurs at build-time, creating 400x400 optimized thumbnails in `content/thumbnails/` directory. GridView loads thumbnails for efficient performance; full media loads on-demand in library viewer. Graceful fallback: items without thumbnails use full media. Automatic fallback to Unsplash mock data occurs if local LFS files are unavailable.
- **Media Playback:** Muted autoplay for videos with tap-to-toggle play/pause, volume control, and a draggable progress bar on desktop. Videos use `playsInline`, `loop`, with platform-specific preload (`preload="metadata"` for iOS PWA, `preload="auto"` for Android/desktop). Videos in the library viewer play with sound. A global AudioContext manages background audio playback for photo viewing, with intelligent pause/resume and automatic track advancement, persisting state across tab switches. iOS compatibility includes specific autoplay and playback fixes, default muted videos, and performance optimizations like reduced prefetch and async decoding. **iOS Touch Handling:** Native touch event listeners attached directly to video/image elements to bypass Safari's touch event suppression. Dual tracking (React state + refs) prevents lag, iOS device detection prevents duplicate handlers on Android, and useEffect dependencies ensure fresh listeners on every media change. **Error Recovery:** Videos have 3-attempt retry logic with exponential backoff for slow connections, automatically resetting on successful load. Songs tab has 2-attempt retry with 10-second timeout for audio loading errors.
- **Library Features:** The Library view includes "Songs" and "Chat" tabs. The "Songs" tab dynamically loads and allows playback of audio from `audio-list.json`, supporting multi-select for custom playlist creation. The "Chat" tab displays filtered Google Chat conversations parsed from an MBOX file, presented as collapsible cards with sender-specific styling and intelligent date extraction.
- **Video Processing:** Automated build-time conversion script uses FFmpeg to process all video formats, including resolution reduction for files over 100MB, specific codecs, and web optimization. Existing MP4 files over 100MB are also processed.
- **PWA & Deployment:** The application is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities. Icons and favicon are generated from a source image (biriyani.jpg). **Service Worker:** The PWA's service worker excludes media files (videos, images, audio) from service worker cache, allowing them to use browser HTTP cache instead - crucial for iOS PWA homescreen apps. Only app shell is cached by service worker. Automated GitHub Pages deployment script handles video conversion, Vite build, path fixing, cache-busting, media/PWA config copying, and git operations for deployment. Search engine protection is implemented via `robots.txt` and meta tags.
- **Caching:** IndexedDB-based caching for all media, with automatic prefetching of next items. Blob URLs are properly tracked and revoked to prevent memory leaks. LocalStorage-based caching is used for other media aspects, with a 24-hour validity and version-based invalidation. HTTP cache-busting uses timestamp query parameters and `no-store`/`no-cache` headers. Cache size is limited to 100MB for iOS compatibility, with proactive cleanup and quota error handling. **iOS Compatibility (All Browsers):** iOS devices (iPhone/iPad on Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) use browser HTTP cache instead of IndexedDB due to WebKit limitations. Reels view loads only current and adjacent items (1 ahead on iOS, 2 on other platforms) to prevent memory issues in iOS PWA. **Fetch Timeout:** All media fetch operations have 30-second timeout protection with AbortController to handle slow connections gracefully.
- **UX Enhancements:** Reels position is preserved when switching views. The browser back button works contextually, and a hard refresh redirects to the landing page, ensuring the birthday message is seen on app entry. Pull-to-refresh behavior has been fixed to prevent unwanted navigation.
- **Build & Deployment:** Streamlined build scripts for GitHub Pages, including automated LFS download using GitHub PAT.

### System Design Choices
- **Fully Static Frontend:** No backend server or authentication, enabling deployment to any static hosting.
- **Mock Data Strategy:** Unsplash images as fallback mock media for development, decoupling frontend from real data.
- **LocalStorage for Persistence:** Liked media status is stored client-side, simplifying implementation but not syncing across devices.
- **Favorite Sorting:** Liked media automatically float to the top in the Library view, consistently applied across all filters.
- **Dynamic Content:** Content lists are generated from local files at build time, simplifying content updates.
